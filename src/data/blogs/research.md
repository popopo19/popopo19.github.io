In the summer of 2021, I was involved in an undergraduate research at St. Olaf College on classifying artificial mutations from cancerous mutations by taking a machine learning approach with Bayes’ Theorem, a mathematical formula for calculating conditional probabilities. I worked with two other undergraduate students and a professor on implementing our classification model using R, a statistical programming language. I was mainly involved in the coding aspect of the project which involved implementing the classification model and the mutation simulation for testing our model. 

When developing the classification model, my peers and I first developed Bayes’ Theorem to take information from our training set and output probabilities of a single mutation being artificial or cancerous. We randomly created mutations with a preset classification following patterns that artificial or cancerous mutations make. Then, we tested our model with the simulated data to check the performance of our model. 

I also worked on wrapping all of our methods and our classification model into an R package called excerno so that the public may use our implementations. In this process, I created documentation of each function and how to use the package. I also organized and modified functions for intuitive usage. Finally, I also ran multiple tests to ensure all functions worked correctly. Once the research project was done, I presented the research to St. Olaf College. 

This experience taught me how a research process goes. It also taught me how to write good code that is understanding and clear and not just code that works. The experience also made me realize the importance of testing, so that future bugs may be prevented.
