        "description": "During the summer of 2022, I worked in a team at Resideo as a firmware engineer. My team was tasked with developing the software for the next thermostat in development. The agile methodology was used by my team, and so I gave updates on my work daily. As an intern, I was given multiple tasks ranging from creating tools for the development process, fixing bugs, and implementing the UI of the thermostat.",
