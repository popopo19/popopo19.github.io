DiSCO is a department at St. Olaf College that provides the necessary tools for students working on creative projects. As a student worker in this department, I helped students record podcasts, make videos using Adobe Premiere, and did a variety of small tasks that contributed to giving DiSCO a welcoming atmosphere. 

## Unity Tutorial Project

I also worked on an independent project developing a video tutorial on the Unity Game Engine, a game development software. I captured all of the footage using OBS, a recording and streaming software. I used Adobe Premiere to make all the video edits, and I also wrote the script which I recorded. In the beginning, my workflow was disorganized. I would record footage for a bit, then write the script, then do some recording. However, as I worked on the project more and tested different workflows, I discover that it was more efficient to write the script first, record the footage, then record the voiceover. Since this video is a tutorial, I had to think about how to give out information clearly and quickly. I got rid of information that wasnâ€™t important and highlighted more important information to make a video game. I also had to give updates to my supervisor daily on the current status of my project. This project taught me how to keep myself on top of deadlines I set for myself. It also taught me how to organize a project efficiently.
