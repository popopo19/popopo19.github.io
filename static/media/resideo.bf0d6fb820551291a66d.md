During the summer of 2022, I worked in a team at Resideo as a firmware engineer. My team was tasked with developing the software for the next thermostat in development. The agile methodology was used by my team, and so I gave updates on my work daily. As an intern, I was given multiple tasks ranging from creating tools for the development process, fixing bugs, and implementing the UI of the thermostat. 

## Developed a python script to automate the build process for the thermostat

The first task that I was given was to write a python script that can automate the building of the source code. This was necessary since the team had to release a build every week. There were also different variations of the source code that needed to be built, so this can be quite time-consuming. My script would pull the latest source code from the repository. Then, the script would make configurations to the source code directly and perform the builds. Once all of the builds were completed, my script pushed the newly generated build files to the repository.

This project as a good starting project for me as it was within my capabilities. Python is a language which I am very comfortable with. I also had all of the necessary skills needed to create the script, such as string regular expressions and familiarly with the terminal. There was also a python script made for a previous thermostat, and so I was able use it as reference. This was a very good project to boost my confidence in the workplace.

## Problem-solved a bug to reduce therometer heat

Next, I was given a big bug to fix. Fixing the bug required me to dive into FreeRTOS, the operating system of the thermostat. FreeRTOS is an operating system (definitely not your typical OS) that is mainly used in microcontrollers. It's main task, like all operating systems, was to help with scheduling task. I knew nothing about FreeRTOS, so I had to research and learn about how the FreeRTOS source code works. To find the bug, I had to understand the source code and program some tests to verify any hypotheses I had about what was causing the bug. I eventually found the cause of the bug with supporting reasons and evidence.

It was hard. Mainly, because I didn't keep track of what I did to try and solve the problem. After learning something related to the bug, I would forget and have to take time to relearn what I had already learn. Half of the time I spent on this problem was probably relearning stuff I already learned but didn't know how I came to those conclusions. I eventually took time to record my findings, and this made life easier.

## Therometer UI work collaboration

The last task I worked on was implementing the UI for the thermostat. I was working with two other co-workers. During this time, my day consisted of implementing the UI, then working with the UI master (the person in charge of the UI implementations) to add my work to the state machine. I also had to communicate with employees outside of my team to get clarifications on what the UI should look like.

## Conclusion

Overall, I enjoyed my time at this internship. I learned a lot about my capabilities. I learned how to work efficiently in a team and the importance of tracking my work. One thing bothering me going into this internship was my lack of knowledge in electrical engineering since I'll be working with microcontrollers. But, I had great people to teach me anything that I didn't know about electrical engineer (or at least the basic). It helped that all the other engineering interns were either majored in computer engineering or electrical engineering. I also had a lot of fun learning new about electronics.  Great summer.
